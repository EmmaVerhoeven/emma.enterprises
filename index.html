                    <h2>United Mental States</h2>
                    <p>United Mental States is a collection of mental-health-inspired islands envisioned by youth
                        from
                        Brabant, that were created during multiple workshops I developed with <a
                            href="https://www.mu.nl/nl" target="_blank">Mu Hybrid Art House</a> over the
                        last year, then translated into a spatial work for their 25-year-anniversary-exhibition
                        Hybrid
                        Tales
                        For Hybrid Times. The various continents in this â€˜3D collageâ€™ represent common States of
                        young
                        minds
                        as associative visual landscapes; a 30 min video projection shows personal interviews about
                        the
                        current state of their mental health, with their self-imagined â€˜mental landscapesâ€™ as
                        backdrops.
                        <br><br>
                        I absolutely loved working with young people, working on serious topics, working in Brabant,
                        working
                        with
                        neurodiverse kids, working with MU, working with my hands, working with friends. I would
                        like to
                        do
                        more of it and get better at it.

                        clues,

                    <h2>Experimental Rehab for Online Buyers (E-ROB)</h2>
                    <p>What if we need E-retail therapy?
                        Every year, thousands of people become victims to online shopping fraud, despite warning
                        campaigns.
                        Why is it that even when we aware of the danger, we can still be deceived? Could there be a
                        deeper
                        drive, overruling our rational judgement, that we need to come to terms with? To investigate
                        this,
                        Extra Practice and the municipality of Haarlem set up E-ROB, the Experimental Rehab for
                        Online
                        Buyers. At DDW we tested, diagnosed and treated visitors to both rE-search and rE-boot their
                        online
                        shopping behaviour.</p>

                    <h2>ThemeWork</h2>
                    <p>ThemeWork is an ongoing series of events hosted at <a href="http://extrapractice.space"
                            target="_blank">Extra
                            Practice</a>,
                        where we collectively work
                        on important and serious unpaid tasks (like filing taxes), but with a unique theme. The
                        theme changes every session, and is reflected in the spaceâ€™s decor, the snacks, the online
                        communication, and sometimes in the dress code. Instead of isolating ourselves with our
                        laptops, we enhance the value of our unpaid work by making it a fun and collective
                        experience. At the same time, we are conducting important research: do we work better if we
                        imagine ourselves in a wellness resort? Or a daycare center? Dressed like cowboys?
                        <br><br>

                    <h2>United Mental States</h2>
                    <p>In these workshops, that I am currently still giving at different students and schools in
                        Brabant,
                        students
                        explore their inner worlds through collective reflection and visualization,
                        identifying common emotional themes which they translate into a collective visual "mental
                        landcape."
                        Beginning with a meditative session and prompts on feelings and thoughts, students
                        categorize
                        their
                        responses into themes like joy, fear, hope, and uncertainty. Together, they create a map
                        illustrating these mental states and their connections, fostering a feeling of connection
                        and
                        providing a way to talk about abstract feelings with a playful distance. </p>
                    <p>Workshops vary from 1 hour to 10 weeks, 5 students to 120 at a time, and outcomes go from
                        outlines of
                        islands to collages to tours through the islands or <a

                    <h2>United Mental States</h2>
                    <p>During 1,5 year of workshops at different highschools in Brabant, I interviewed some of the
                        participating students in front of a green screen. I asked them to pretend to be inside the
                        landscape they had designed based on emotions and thoughts during the workshop, and asked
                        them
                        questions about the feelings that were represented in that landscape. The backdrops are
                        based on
                        their own creations made in the workshop, translated into animatd backgrounds. The
                        interviews
                        together became this film which was screened alongside the physical islands installation in
                        MU.
