                <h2>United Mental States</h2>
                <p>United Mental States is a collection of mental-health-inspired islands envisioned by youth from
                    Brabant, that were created during multiple workshops I developed with <a href="https://www.mu.nl/nl"
                        target="_blank">Mu Hybrid Art House</a> over the
                    last year, then translated into a spatial work for their 25-year-anniversary-exhibition Hybrid Tales
                    For Hybrid Times. The various continents in this ‘3D collage’ represent common States of young minds
                    as associative visual landscapes; a 30 min video projection shows personal interviews about the
                    current state of their mental health, with their self-imagined ‘mental landscapes’ as backdrops.
                    <br><br>
                    I absolutely loved working with young people, working on serious topics, working in Brabant, working
                    with
                    neurodiverse kids, working with MU, working with my hands, working with friends. I would like to do
                    more of it and get better at it.

                <h2>Escape Here Now</h2>
                <p>If you’ve ever experienced an escape room, you will know the thrill of looking around for clues,
                    finding patterns in everything, and feeling like the hero in a real adventure story. For under €30
                    you can have a fun hour trying to crack codes and find the key to your fake escape.
                    But escape rooms are just superficial entertaining experiences you can buy, and I want to spend my
                    time productively and meaningfully. I want to play the lead role in my own adventure. I want real
                    experiences!</p>
                <p>
                    I want to travel the world to discover myself, go on a retreat to find myself. Lift up my soul on
                    the yoga mat, but also keep both feet on the ground; need to stay down to earth. Straightforward.
                    Got to move forward. Set goals, reach my full potential. Push myself, be more productive. Dream big,
                    trust the universe. Let go of fears and stress. Do what I want! Enjoy life, live it to the fullest.
                    Have fun, be free, escape!
                </p>
                <i>
                    This escape room will make you more productive, centered, grounded, motivated, charismatic, kind,
                    beautiful, creative, healthy, ambitious, fit, profitable, driven, relaxed, calm, happy, passionate,
                    reflective, aware, brave, humble, confident, intelligent, skilled, accepting, balanced… play a
                    thrilling game of self-discovery and escape from the maze of self-improvement!

                <h2>Experimental Rehab for Online Buyers (E-ROB)</h2>
                <p>What if we need E-retail therapy?
                    Every year, thousands of people become victims to online shopping fraud, despite warning campaigns.
                    Why is it that even when we aware of the danger, we can still be deceived? Could there be a deeper
                    drive, overruling our rational judgement, that we need to come to terms with? To investigate this,
                    Extra Practice and the municipality of Haarlem set up E-ROB, the Experimental Rehab for Online
                    Buyers. At DDW we tested, diagnosed and treated visitors to both rE-search and rE-boot their online
                    shopping behaviour.</p>
                <p>A collaboration between myself, Benjamin Earl and Gijs de Boer, partnered with Municipality of
                    Haarlem and LMIO, as part of the What
                    If Lab and the Embassy of Safety during Dutch Design Week 2019.</p>

                <h2>Guardians of the Amazon</h2>
                <p>For this collaboration with Greenpeace NL, I gathered a large collection of images that represent the
                    Indigenous people of the Amazon, found in
                    historical archives, Greenpeace media sources, Western and Brazilian media. In a series of vibrant
                    posters and a video
                    collage I explore my fascination with the different conflicting roles or identities which
                    Indigenous people could be associated with, depending on who is creating images of them.</p>

                <h2>VRcation</h2>
                <p>What do we really seek when we travel? Holiday deals are sold to us like mass products which make
                    vacationing seem no more than the consumption of fabricated tourist experiences. So how is passively
                    travelling within the comfortable tourism bubble, far removed from local realities and authenticity,
                    different from seeing a destination through VR-goggles? VRcation was a speculative travel agency
                    selling virtual vacations. Order this new-style package deal online: mix various sights,
                    environments and tours to your own desire, complete with home-delivered accessories. Put your
                    goggles on, stick your feet in the sand and enjoy your personal package deal without even packing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    VRcation was inspired by, and then presented at Vakantiebeurs Utrecht.

                <h1>Workshop/Event</h1>
                <h2>ThemeWork</h2>
                <p>ThemeWork is an ongoing series of events hosted at <a href="http://extrapractice.space"
                        target="_blank">Extra
                        Practice</a>,
                    where we collectively work
                    on important and serious unpaid tasks (like filing taxes), but with a unique theme. The
                    theme changes every session, and is reflected in the space’s decor, the snacks, the online
                    communication, and sometimes in the dress code. Instead of isolating ourselves with our
                    laptops, we enhance the value of our unpaid work by making it a fun and collective
                    experience. At the same time, we are conducting important research: do we work better if we
                    imagine ourselves in a wellness resort? Or a daycare center? Dressed like cowboys?
                    <br><br>

                <h2>United Mental States</h2>
                <p>In these workshops, that I am currently still giving at different students and schools in Brabant,
                    students
                    explore their inner worlds through collective reflection and visualization,
                    identifying common emotional themes which they translate into a collective visual "mental landcape."
                    Beginning with a meditative session and prompts on feelings and thoughts, students categorize their
                    responses into themes like joy, fear, hope, and uncertainty. Together, they create a map
                    illustrating these mental states and their connections, fostering a feeling of connection and
                    providing a way to talk about abstract feelings with a playful distance. </p>
                <p>Workshops vary from 1 hour to 10 weeks, 5 students to 120 at a time, and outcomes go from outlines of
                    islands to collages to tours through the islands or <a href="http://united-mental-states.glitch.me"

                <p>The 6-week course I co-developed as part of Translocal Lives, a research project by Amanda Paz
                    Alencar. I got to teach 14 newcomers in Rotterdam to translate
                    their ideas on place-making and belonding into short films, using their smartphones and open-source
                    software. We screened the final films in KINO Rotterdam.</p>

                <h2>United Mental States</h2>
                <p>During 1,5 year of workshops at different highschools in Brabant, I interviewed some of the
                    participating students in front of a green screen. I asked them to pretend to be inside the
                    landscape they had designed based on emotions and thoughts during the workshop, and asked them
                    questions about the feelings that were represented in that landscape. The backdrops are based on
                    their own creations made in the workshop, translated into animatd backgrounds. The interviews
                    together became this film which was screened alongside the physical islands installation in MU.</p>
