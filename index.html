            <h2>FAQ</h2>

            <details>
                <summary>What does Emma Verhoeven do, exactly?</summary>

                <p>
                    Listen, there's just a lot of things, ok. Emma never chose one path, one medium or one topic, but
                    instead just followed all her whims and interests and that means that now she finds this question
                    quite
                    hard to answer, even though she really enjoys all of the things does! She basically goes to the
                    studio
                    (XP) whenever she
                    can, and works on either something to pay the bills, like video editing or graphic design or
                    illustration (if you're looking for someone, hit her up), or something
                    she
                    <i>wants</i> to do, like building a weird game or organising a ThemeWork event or writing a
                    <a href="http://newsletter.extrapractice.space">newsletter</a>
                    or something else.
                </p>

                <details>
                    <summary>Ok, but if she had to choose one description, what would we call Emma?</summary>

                    <p>
                        Emma often uses the word 'media artist' (or 'mediakunstenaar' in Dutch) to describe herself. It
                        works
                        quite well because she uses a lot of different media as her <i>material</i>, her work is often
                        <i>about</i> digital media and then the result also is often <i>formatted</i> in a (partly)
                        digital
                        medium. But you can just call her Emma

            <details>
                <summary>How does Emma make a living?</summary>

                <p>
                    Understandable question! Besides the fun autonomous stuff, Emma teaches workshops, sometimes at art
                    academies, often at high schools via <a href="https://mu.nl">MU Hybrid Art House</a>, and also gets
                    hired to do animations, video
                    editing,
                    graphic design and illustration for both companies and individuals. She even does translation work
                    if you
                    pay

                    <p>ThemeWork is an ongoing series of events hosted at <a href="http://extrapractice.space"
                            target="_blank">Extra Practice</a>,
                        where we collectively work on important and serious unpaid tasks (like filing taxes), but
                        with a unique theme. The
                        theme changes every session, and is reflected in the space‚Äôs decor, the snacks, the online
                        communication, and sometimes in the dress code.
                        Instead of isolating ourselves with our laptops, we enhance the value of our unpaid work by
                        making it a fun and collective experience.
                        At the same time, we are conducting important research: do we work better if we imagine
                        ourselves in a wellness resort? Or a daycare center? Dressed like cowboys?
                        <br><br>

                    These days, Emma is designing & illustrating money bills for a time bank, teaching her UMS
                    workshop
                    at a
                    highschool in Geldrop, and continuing a thread she started last spring about regenerative
                    living.
                    It's
                    also getting wintery, so she is taking it easy and going to the cinema a lot.

                <summary>What does Emma want to achieve in the future?</summary>

                <p>
                    Excellent question. The answer has often changed... Currently, Emma is working & dreaming with
                    her
                    two
                    sisters on a plan to
                    start a regenerative farm together, where she will take care of the community building and arts
                    &
                    culture
                    part of the organisation... What a beautiful dream. It might come true sooner than they think!
