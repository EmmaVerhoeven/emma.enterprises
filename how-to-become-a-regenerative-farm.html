    <h1>Workshop</h1>
    <p>
        We’ll combine the ‘worldbuilding as therapy’ method with elements from the regenerative
        farming metaphor, creating a subjective, holistic map of our inner farmland & professional ecosystem that can be
        used as a reference/guide for envisioning a regenerative practice ♻️
        We are going to farm ourselves. No worries, it does not hurt.
